* Story *

Of a lovely lady, who was bringing u- oh sorry ;P

A crazy old bastard is about to die.  So he hears about this Xen world.  He hires a bunch of workers to build him this tomb out of old ancient pyramid parts in the Xen universe.  The only thing is, they don’t know that he plans to do the exact thing as the ancient Egyptian Kings did.  Seal up everyone who knows, so no one will ever find out where his stash, and his body are!  Yes.  You just found out your really a construction worker :)  Have fun!
