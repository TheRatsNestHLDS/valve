------Additional Info, Tips, and Notes-------------------------------

OK, in the childrens room (the one with the Limp Bizkit poster) you can 
shoot a wall. Behind it, you will find something... You can go through the
carpet... 
In the little Xen area, the gravity is very low. You don't need to jump
to get to the gauss.

You can gib the Barney liing outside. If you find out how, mail me. You
may become a beta tester for my new map.

If you press the Cartman poster, Cartman will sing the Bitch Song. (yes, the
BITCH SONG)

If someone gets the Gauss, Weird Al will sing "Merry Christmas to all, now
you all gonna die!"
