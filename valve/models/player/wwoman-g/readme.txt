Character Info:
This model is based on Wonder Woman of  DC comics.
I used Steve Gerhke's Dawn model for the base, with a 
repaint of the colors, featuring Lynda Carter's face.
(The only Wonder Woman most of us ever knew.)
This model is available in both a G-rating; (With the
original TV show costume) [Wwoman-G.mdl]
And an R-rating; (A risque creation that we only wish
the lovely Ms. Carter had worn.) [Wwoman-R.mdl]
