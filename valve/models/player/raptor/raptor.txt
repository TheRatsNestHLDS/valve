Known bugs:
As there is just a slight amount of polygon clipping on this one.

Comments:
Raptor would have had a lower polygon account, but then I'd have to trade in his smoove arms and legs
for blocks of similar shape, which would have given the model a less, raptor-like shape.  

Description:
Its a blood thirsty raptor, who is skilled in the use of automatic weapons.(He loves to jump and beat them scientist with a crowbar.)

Installation:

Model Files: Just put the folder labeled raptor in your valve models folder under player.
Optional Extras:  I'm thinking of making a raptor claw to replace the crowbar.

Distribution:
Send it to your friends, family, and victims, but be sure to include this file.
